## Reflection
The project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself React's Context API.

I wanted to build an application that uses Reactâ€™s Context API to manage global application state without resorting to props drilling.
I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into react hook and Context API. The technologies used in this app are React and CSS.

One challenge I had was that when user refreshed the page, any data user has entered was lost. To combat this I stored the data in the local storage.
In the next iteration I plan on building a backend with a database to store user data essentially making this a fullstack app.
